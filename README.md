## Minesweeper
>This was part of one of my Projects in the AI50 course I have completed recently

>pygame, python, itertools, random, copy, AI50

My minesweeper uses pygame and GUI to open a new tab,and let the user enjoy playing minesweeper

Language(s) used:
Python

How does the webpage work?
The idea is simple. The user has to run 'python runner.py' in the correct folder in the terminal

## About AI50
AI50 explores the concepts and algorithms at the foundation of modern artificial intelligence, diving into the ideas that give rise to technologies like game-playing engines, handwriting recognition, and machine translation. Through hands-on projects, students gain exposure to the theory behind graph search algorithms, classification, optimization, reinforcement learning, and other topics in artificial intelligence and machine learning as they incorporate them into their own Python programs. By course’s end, students emerge with experience in libraries for machine learning as well as knowledge of artificial intelligence principles that enable them to design intelligent systems of their own.
It is taught mostly by Brian Yu

Introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming. This course teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, and software engineering. Languages include C, Python, and SQL plus students’ choice of: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (for web development).

Thank you for all AI50.
